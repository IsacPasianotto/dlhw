## Requirements: 

The complete text of the assignment is available [at the course repository](https://github.com/emaballarin/deeplearning-units/blob/main/assignments/assignment_01.md).
A backup version of the document is also stored in this repository at [Assignment.md](./Assignment.md).

To sum up, the requirement is to reproduce the experiment in fig 1 of the paper [“Learning representations by back-propagating errors” (Rumelhart et al., 1986)](https://bucket.ballarin.cc/papers/oth/rumelhart1986.pdf) (Backup link for the paper if unavailable [here](https://gwern.net/doc/ai/nn/1986-rumelhart-2.pdf).


**Observations:**
- The paper is quite old, and the required computation are light enough to be run on a CPU of a modern laptop. For this reason I will not consider the GPU porting of the code and I will not use any cloud service like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or whatever.
